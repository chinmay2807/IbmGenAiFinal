Dialogue Summarization and Detoxification using Generative AI and Reinforcement Learning
In this project, we addressed the challenge of generating concise and non-toxic summaries from multi-turn dialogues using generative AI. Our objectives were:

To understand and apply advanced generative models for the task of dialogue summarization.

To ensure generated summaries are not only accurate but also free from toxic or inappropriate content.

To leverage reinforcement learning (specifically PPO) with a reward model that discourages toxic outputs.
